**1.3. STRUCTURE**

Simplicity and consistency while keeping in mind user-friendly design was the strategy for the look of this website. Design is based on most modern look and feel for a single page structure.

This is a website with a single scrolling page with 6 separate page areas as follows:
- Home / About
- Menu
- Gallery
- Testimonials
- Offers
- Contact

Navigation menu has got links to each of the page sections, which makes it easy to navigate.
The ‘Menu’ section has got a downloadable menu if user prefers to view it this way.
Both, the header and the footer have links to social media.
The footer includes some key information, such as opening times, contact details and links to social media. Users can also download the menu from the footer.

**1.4. SKELETON**

The aim here was to outline the basic structure of the project according to what users really need, in order to get the best out of visiting this page, bearing in mind the priority of information being presented.

Wireframes were firstly sketched on a whiteboard. This method helped with brainstorming, deciding the most essential parts of the website, and getting the feel for the website as a whole.

Please find the links to sketched wireframes below:

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)  (provide hyperlink) was the tool used in this project to finalise previously sketched wireframes. Below are low fidelity wireframes.

- [Tablet wireframe](/workspace/shake-up-milestone-one/assets/images/wireframes/balsamiq-tablet-wireframe.pdf)
- [Desktop wireframe](/workspace/shake-up-milestone-one/assets/images/wireframes/balsamiq-desktop-wireframe.pdf)

Note: Throughout the design phase some elements of the design changed to allow for a better user experience; i.e tablet wireframe included, however with a very few differences in comparison with the mobile wireframe – difference in size of objects.

## 1.5. SURFACE 
This section defines the visual language of the website.
### Design 

**Colour Scheme**

These are the colours I decided to use for my website: [https://coolors.co/167709-c03221-f7f7ff-f2d0a4-545e75](https://coolors.co/167709-c03221-f7f7ff-f2d0a4-545e75)

The green (#167709) colour was chosen to create a refreshing feeling and sense of healthy lifestyle. People feel safe with green colour.

I  selected complimentary colours, in order for the users to have a more exciting or joyful experience when navigating through. 

#F2D0A4 colour (Peach colour) was mainly used for the header and footer backgrounds, as well as for the main section headings, so the user can instantly recognise the main headings. The colour peach is known to be an excellent colour for communication, it also has much influence on good manners and calm. It gives a feeling of joy.

#C03221 (International Orange colour) was used on hovered icons. Similar to a Lava Red colour, it brings more warms and vibrancy onto the website. 

**Language / Tone**
I wanted it to be casual and fun, hence the decision about implementing fun descriptions under the Shake Menu items. 

## 2. FEATURES

### 2.1. Existing features

**The Header**:
-  Logo - Shake Up has it's own logo and identity. There is a name of the place inside of the logo, so users can instantly recognise the 'Shake Up' brand.
- Navigation bar - includes About, Menu Gallery, Testimonials, Offers and Contact Section. Under menu dropdown there is an option to download the menu. On the right hand site are social links. Upon hovering, they change colour to darker red.
Aim of navigation bar is for users to easily and intuitively navigate through the website. 
The navigation bar is toggled on small devices.
- Under the header, users will see the main image as soon as they enter the site with a 'Shake Up' motto. The image is animated - uses backwards image zoom. 

**The Footer**  includes:
- 'Shake Up' name and a short description.
- Icon to download a menu
- Opening Hours
- Contact Details: Address of the place, phone number as well as email address.
- Links to social media, that are also in the header. As this is a fictional shake bar, the links are taking the user to the main page of each of the social media platforms. 

The above information is grouped into 3 different columns on medium and larger devices, with the list to social links in the bottom middle of the screen. On small devices, it all goes into one column, with social media links moving to the bottom of the 'Contact Us' column, therefore staying on the bottom of the screen. 

Both the Header and the Footer are have the same colour to maintain good user experience. All links open in separate tabs.

**About section**  includes:

- 'Our Story' - provides information on when the Shake Bar was opened and who visits. It also lets the user know how the menu is maintained and updated. 
- 'Our Ingredients' -  describes the ethos of the place and provides information about products.
-  This section is using Bootstrap grid system - on small devices, all columns are put together, vertically.

**Menu section**  includes:
- Menu is divided into 4 main categories: Breakfast, Lunch, All Day, and shots, so everyone finds something for themselves, also depending on the time of the day. All Menu items have an image, so potential customers can get a feeling of what they would get in reality.
- Downloadable link, so the user can download the menu directly from the menu section.

**Gallery section**  includes:

- This section is linked to Instagram. User can see 6 photos of the place, and if they would like to view more, they can follow 'Shake Up' on Instagram.

**Testimonials section**  includes:

- 6 testimonial cards with two type of controls: arrows on left and right hand side, as well as control buttons below the testimonial card. On top of the review description, user can see the name of the person providing a review as well as their profession. Each testimonial has also got a rating. 

**Offers section**  includes:

- Two types of offers: one is a loyalty card where regular customer can get their 10th shake for free; another one is a student/NHS discount, offering 15% off.

**Contact section**  includes:

- Contact form implemented to let the user send any query they may have.
- Above 'Send' button, user can subscribe to a newsletter.

- Map - shows user the location of 'Shake Up". User can check how to get the place from their current location. 

**Features Still to Implement**

If this was a website promoting a real place, I would implement the following features:
- Make the fixed header transparent, so when user scrolls down, they can see through.
- Menu section: buttons with info about calories to be implemented.
- Video of the owner introducing the place in the 'About' section, to make the page more interactive. 
- Under the 'Gallery' section, next to 'Follow us on Instagram', I would include another option to 'Load More Pictures' should users not want to go to Instagram and instead prefer to view more pictures on the website. 
- Under 'Offers' section, a link to more offers which would take user to a separate page with shake .competitions for loyal customers, and more loyalty programmes.
- I would have included the links to real social media accounts.
