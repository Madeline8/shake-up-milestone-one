**1.3. STRUCTURE**
Simplicity and consistency while keeping in mind user-friendly design was the strategy for the look of this website. Design is based on most modern look and feel for a single page structure.

This is a website with a single scrolling page with 6 separate page areas as follows:
- Home / About
- Menu
- Gallery
- Testimonials
- Offers
- Contact

Navigation menu has got links to each of the page sections, which makes it easy to navigate.
The ‘Menu’ section has got a downloadable menu if user prefers to view it this way.
Both, the header and the footer have links to social media.
The footer includes some key information, such as opening times, contact details and links to social media. Users can also download the menu from the footer.

**1.4. SKELETON**
The aim here was to outline the basic structure of the project according to what users really need, in order to get the best out of visiting this page, bearing in mind the priority of information being presented.

Wireframes were firstly sketched on a whiteboard. This method helped with brainstorming, deciding the most essential parts of the website, and getting the feel for the website as a whole.

Please find the links to sketched wireframes below:

-  [Header and footer on desktop, whiteboard wireframe](/workspace/shake-up-milestone-one/assets/images/wireframes/whiteboard-header-and-footer-desktop.jpg)
- [Header and footer on mobile, whiteboard wireframe](/workspace/shake-up-milestone-one/assets/images/wireframes/whiteboard-header-and-footer-mobile.jpg)
- [About on mobile and desktop, whiteboard wireframe](/workspace/shake-up-milestone-one/assets/images/wireframes/whiteboard-about-desktop-and-mobile.jpg)
- [Menu on mobile and desktop, whiteboard wireframe](/workspace/shake-up-milestone-one/assets/images/wireframes/whiteboard-menu-desktop-and-mobile.jpg)
- [Gallery on mobile and desktop, whiteboard wireframe](/workspace/shake-up-milestone-one/assets/images/wireframes/whiteboard-insta-desktop-and-mobile.jpg)
- [Testimonials on mobile and desktop, whiteboard wireframe](/workspace/shake-up-milestone-one/assets/images/wireframes/whiteboard-reviews-desktop-and-mobile.jpg)

- [Contact on mobile and desktop, whiteboard wireframe](/workspace/shake-up-milestone-one/assets/images/wireframes/whiteboard-contact-desktop-and-mobile.jpg)

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)  (provide hyperlink) was the tool used in this project to finalise previously sketched wireframes. Below are low fidelity wireframes.

- [Mobile wireframe](/workspace/shake-up-milestone-one/assets/images/wireframes/balsamiq-mobile-wireframe.pdf)
- [Tablet wireframe](/workspace/shake-up-milestone-one/assets/images/wireframes/balsamiq-tablet-wireframe.pdf)
- [Desktop wireframe](/workspace/shake-up-milestone-one/assets/images/wireframes/balsamiq-desktop-wireframe.pdf)

Note: Throughout the design phase some elements of the design changed to allow for a better user experience; i.e tablet wireframe included, however with a very few differences in comparison with the mobile wireframe – difference in size of objects.

## 1.5. SURFACE 
This section defines the visual language of the website.
### Design 

**Colour Scheme**

These are the colours I decided to use for my website: [https://coolors.co/167709-c03221-f7f7ff-f2d0a4-545e75](https://coolors.co/167709-c03221-f7f7ff-f2d0a4-545e75)

The green (#167709) colour was chosen to create a refreshing feeling and sense of healthy lifestyle. People feel safe with green colour.

I  selected complimentary colours, in order for the users to have a more exciting or joyful experience when navigating through. 

#F2D0A4 colour (Peach colour) was mainly used for the header and footer backgrounds, as well as for the main section headings, so the user can instantly recognise the main headings. The colour peach is known to be an excellent colour for communication, it also has much influence on good manners and calm. It gives a feeling of joy.

#C03221 (International Orange colour) was used on hovered icons. Similar to a Lava Red colour, it brings more warms and vibrancy onto the website. 

**Typography**

[The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.]

**Imagery**

[Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.]

## 2. FEATURES
### 2.1. Existing features

**The Header**:
-  Logo - Shake Up has it's own logo and identity. There is a name of the place inside of the logo, so users can instantly recognise the 'Shake Up' brand.
- Navigation bar - includes About, Menu Gallery, Testimonials, Offers and Contact Section. Under menu dropdown there is an option to download menu. On the right hand site are social links. 
Aim of navigation bar is for users to easily and intuitively navigate through the website. 
The navigation bar is toggled on small devices.

- Under the header, users will see the main image as soon as they enter the site with a 'Shake Up' motto.

**The Footer**  includes:
- 'Shake Up' name and a short description.
- Icon to download a menu
- Opening Hours
- Contact Details: Address of the place, phone number as well as email address.
- Links to social media, that are also in the header. As this is a fictional shake bar, the links are taking user to the main page of each of the social media platforms. 

The above information is grouped into 3 different columns on medium and larger devices, with the list to social links in the bottom middle of the screen. On small devices, it all goes into one column, with social media links moving to the bottom of the 'Contact Us' column, therefore staying on the bottom of the screen. 

Both the Header and the Footer are have the same colour to maintain good user experience. All links are open in separate tabs.

**About section**  includes:

- 'Our Story' - provides information on when the Shake Bar was opened and who visits it. It also lets the user know how the menu is maintained and updated. 
- 'Our Ingredients' -  describes the ethos of the place and provides information about products. 

**Menu section**  includes:
- Menu is divided into 4 main categories: Breakfast, Lunch, All Day, and shots, so everyone finds something for themselves, also depending on the time of the day. All Menu items have the image, so potential customers can get a feeling of what they would get in reality.
- Downloadable link, so the user get download the menu directly form the menu section.

**Gallery section**  includes:

- This section is linked to Instagram. User can see 6 photos of the place, and if they would like to view more, they can follow 'Shake Up' on Instagram.

**Testimonials section**  includes:

- 6 testimonial cards with two type of controls: arrows on left and right hand side, as well as control buttons below the testimonial card. On top of the review description, user can see the name of the person providing a review as well as their profession. Each testimonial has also got a rating. 

**Offers section**  includes:

- Two types of offers: one is a loyalty card where regular customer can get their 10th shake for free; another one is a student/NHS discount, with 15% off.
- Link to more offers (as this is a fictional website, link takes to main Google page). 

**Contact section**  includes:

- Contact form implemented to let the user send any query they may have
- Above 'Send' button, user can subscribe to a newsletter.

**Map** - shows user the location of 'Shake Up". User can check how to get the place from their current location. 

**Features Left to Implement**
If it was a website promoting a real place, I would implement the following features next:

- Menu section: buttons with info about calories to be implemented.
Contact section: implement a pop up window, when user click on the "i" icon next to 'Subscribe to our Newsletter".

After the 'Contact' section, there is an arrow 'Back To Top'. Upon click, it will take the user to About' section. Upon clicking 'View larger map', it takes the user to a separate Google Maps tab.

## 4. TESTING

The testing process can be found here.

- **Code Validation**

I used [W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) by coping the contents from my index.html and style.css file and pasting into ‘Validate by Direct Input’ field.

![HTML Validation Service - Results](/workspace/shake-up-milestone-one/assets/images/readme-images/html-validation.png)
I considered and tried adhering to what the validator suggests, however, I decided to ignore it in the end. When I was changing the size to % or px, the map did not take a full horizontal space on the page - it was too narrow. When I was testing my page the map looked correct on all devices, hence why I have decided to leave it as it is. 

Before validating my CSS file, I user I used [https://autoprefixer.github.io/](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) - it is a ‘Autoprefixer is a PostCSS plugin which parses CSS and adds vendor prefixes’.

![CSS Validation Service - Results  - Errors](/workspace/shake-up-milestone-one/assets/images/readme-images/css-validator-error.png)

I  reviewed all my comments, as well as made sure all curly braces have their closing tags. I found that just before line 647 there was an unnecessary "`*/`". This has fixed the error. The results once I have run the CSS validation again, looks like this:

![CSS Validation Service - Resuts - No Error](/workspace/shake-up-milestone-one/assets/images/readme-images/css-validator-noerror.png)

I have also received some warnings:
![CSS Validation Service - Results - Warnings](/workspace/shake-up-milestone-one/assets/images/readme-images/css-validator-warnings.png)

-- Line 
The final results as per the screenshots below. 



I also used [https://autoprefixer.github.io/](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) - it is a ‘Autoprefixer is a PostCSS plugin which parses CSS and adds vendor prefixes’.

RESPONSIVENESS – DEVICE COMPATIBILITY

I used Google Chrome DevTools [https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) to make sure all layout is correct and the user has a pleasant experience when navigating through the page.

Site was tested on multiple mobile devices such as:
iPhone5/SE
iPhone 6/7/8
iPhone 6/7/8 Plus
iPhone X
iPad
iPad Pro

All links have been manually tested. They will open in a new tab using ‘target=”_blank”.

BROWSER COMPATIBILITY

Site was tested across various browsers, such as:

Chrome
Mozilla FireFox
Internet Explorer
Edge
Safari

TESTING USER STORIES FROM USER EXPERIENCE (UX) SECTION

 
KNOWN BUGS

- Styling issue: Space between 'Social Links' and 'Contact Us' is a little too big on extra small devices.
- in Testimonials section, I had a problem with alignment of the cards on smaller devices. They were going too far to the right side of the screen. I contacted tutor support with that and I worked out how to centre testimonial cards:  I targeted the .card class and overwrote the default margins that Bootstrap automatically adds to the cards. In the CSS file, I applied the following: `margin: 0 auto !important`. In order to leave the spacing as they are on larger devices, I decided to apply overwritten code to media queries for smaller devices, less than 768px. 
	- Another issue related to the testimonials section, was that on smaller devices, the two active cards were vertically aligned on the screen. I wanted just one card at a time on small devices, not two. To fix this, I applied grid system to the carousel. 

- When I first created all the sections, I had not realised that HTML was not aligned; there was a big space on the right hand side. My mentor advised me to comment out everything and work step by step to find where the issue lay. This is what I did. However, I have not managed to recreate everything in one day and therefore I had to commit changes with uncommented code for the rest of the sections I created earlier, on Github. I am fully aware this is not ideal, however I hope this can be accepted, as long as the final push doesn’t have any unnecessary commented out code.
